## Basics of Database and Database Management System

A Database basically is a collection of realated information about everything. We can store a database in physics ledgers, papers,ect. Database is the raw data collected structurely in order to write and query data quickly.
In order to manage database effectively, Database Management System (DBMS) was build with many features helps us to manages and manipulates  data. DBMS only be stored on the computer because tasks must be executed by the computer. DBMS allows a large number of people access the data at the same time.

## Relational and Non Relational Databases

Relational and Non Relational Databases are two kind of database management systems. A relational database is structured, whereas NoSQL is semi-structured or unstructured.n the relational database(SQL), it consists of tables(fields and records), whereas non-relational database data is stored in form of graphs, documents(XML, JSON).

A relational database or relational database management system(RDBMS) stores data in the form of a table. A relational database consists of tables, and a table consists of rows and columns. Each table has a special column that contains only distinct and unique values that are called primary key. This primary key is used to define the relationship between the tables. The primary key of a table is used for connect with a foreign key of other table. That makes relation for whole the database and leads to three kind of the relationship: 
> One-to-one: Relationship means that each record in Table A relates to one, and only one, record in Table B, and each record in Table B relates to one, and only one, record in Table A.

> One-to-many: Relationship means a record in Table A can relate to zero, one, or many records in Table B. Many records in Table B can relate to one record in Table A.


> Many-to-many: Relationship means a record in Table A can relate to many records in Table B and a record in Table B can relate to many records in Table A.
